### Coronary Heart Disease Risk Prediction

---

#### Introduction

Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a significant health issue worldwide, contributing substantially to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Early identification of individuals at risk of developing CHD is crucial for effective preventive measures and interventions. This project focuses on utilizing data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to gain insights into factors influencing Ten-Year CHD risk and develop a reliable predictive model.

#### Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting Ten-Year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk using machine learning techniques. The project involves:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
- Building predictive models using various algorithms.
- Evaluating model performance and selecting the best model.
- Providing insights into the factors influencing CHD risk.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, etc. (Refer to `requirements.txt`)

---

#### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SVICKY1617/Inlustro_Final_Project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the analysis and modeling process.

4. Run the scripts in `src/` to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
